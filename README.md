## Project Description
eoDrumz is a simple drum machine app consisting of 9 drum/input buttons with a simple visual component displaying the sound picked, played or triggered by the user via a tap, keyboard [Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z , X, C] key press or mouse click. An array is used to store the drum's sounds src links attached to an identifier & mapped onto the display as interactive buttons. The app was developed using React & [refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) are created using [React.createRef()](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) together with the [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) attribute within a HTML5 'audio' tag to create a reference and enable timely audio playback and visual updates to the user. Input from user is therefore processed systematically using an event listener to output the requested sound with an updated text of the most recently played sound. The drum machine app is styled using Sass, CSS (Grid, Flexboxes, Media Query) & the most popular front-end framework rebuilt for React, React Bootstrap.
